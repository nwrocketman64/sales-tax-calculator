# Overview

This simple application that calculates the sales tax behind a product.
To use the application, you need to enter in the price of the product,
the number of products you have, and then the current sales tax. The
calculator will then return the results below the form.

The reason I created this app was to learn how to create a web app
using Python and the Flask framework. I need to learn this because
I am going to make a full website later on in the future using these
tools.

# Web Pages

There are two web pages, the first being the main page or the index
page, the second being a simple 404 page. Enter the values will only
redirect you back to the original web page with the results in hand.

# Development Environment

My main development tool was Microsoft's Visual Studio Code and the
Python interpreter.

I used the Python programming language and the Flask framework along
with a few extentions to complete the project.
